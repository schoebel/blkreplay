It seems that some people

 that synthetic benchmarks can be used even at the position of the dash

 These people are wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiences at big data centers at 1&1 show that sometimes the differences
 between results from artificial benchmarks and real-world application behaviour
 are very large.
 We found cases where artificial benchmarks (adjusting parameters like IOPS)
 suggested that a particular application 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 run on a particular hardware system, but the real application 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
: after deployment, a systematic series of incidents

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Sometimes we got results in the other direction: artificial benchmarks suggested

 The failed prediction from the artificial benchmarks led to a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What can we do about that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, parameters like IOPS (even when enriched with attributes like
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average IOPS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

peak IOPS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 representative for description of the real-world behaviour of applications.
 Attempts to describe real-world behaviour in mathematical terms of analytic
 functions have been already made in the 1970's; they failed.
 All such models can 
\emph on
try
\emph default
 to describe an 
\emph on
approximation
\emph default
 of real-world behaviour, if enough knowledge about the application 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 be available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So why trying to deal with tools that never can fully describe real-world
 application behaviour, when there 
\emph on
exist
\emph default
 tools which definitely 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them is 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
How 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Principle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some sense, 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 is just the opposite of the well-known Linux kernel tool 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
: recordings made by 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 are simply replayed on 
\emph on
another
\emph default
 block device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 record of an IO request contains the following information:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
timestamp of the IO request (nanosecond resolution)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
position of the IO request (sector#)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
length of the IO request (#sectors)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
direction: R[ead] or W[write]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 records do 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 contain any data.
 Therefore, 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 must later generate some 
\emph on
fake data
\emph default
 in order to repeat the timely and positionly behaviour of the original
 recording.
 By default, NULL blocks enriched with some internal header information
 are generated.
 The internal headers may be used for 
\emph on
verification
\emph default
 of the correctness of IO semantics, either by immediate re-read after each
 write, or in a separate verify pass after the end of an ordinary 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that these NULL blocks will (together with the internal header informatio
n) 
\series bold
destroy
\series default
 any previous content (such as filesystem data) on your block device!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, 
\emph on
never
\emph default
 use 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 on production systems.

Although a single Linux kernel instance tries to probihit such a disaster,
 there are cases where you can

achieve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that effect.
 Examples are iSCSI connections to the same iSCSI target in parallel.
\end_layout

 will certainly destroy your data and almost certainly crash your kernel.

 They should be at least at a senior level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Architecture of 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main challenge for 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 is to generate 
\series bold
sufficient IO parallelism
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ordinary production systems like web servers are serving many thousands
 of HTTP requests per second, which may lead to an IO parallelism at the
 block level of several hundred outstanding IO requests at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to simulate such a behaviour in the lab, there are principally
 two alternatives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
use the 
\family typewriter
aio
\family default
 interface of the kernel to fire off a large number of IO requests in parallel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
use a sufficiently large number of kernel threads or processes in parallel,
 where each of them fires up only at most one IO request at the same time
 (blocking IO).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current version of 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 supports only method 2; method 1 is planned for a future release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Method 2 is motivated by a typical Apache behaviour: it is almost a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fork bomb
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in particular under high connection rates and slow block devices.
 A high number of ordinary Unix processes is doing conventional 
\family typewriter
read()
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
write()
\family default
 operations in parallel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For easy portability even to historic Unix flavours, 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 uses ordinary Unix processes generated by simple 
\family typewriter
fork()
\family default
s and communicating via anonymous pipes, in favour to a shared-memory 
\family typewriter
pthreads
\family default
 model.
 However, future versions may also support 
\family typewriter
pthreads

 that you understand the concepts described in this chapter.
 Otherwise you may produce

In the live system, 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 will 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

listen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the events occurring at point A, and will record them.
 In this example, we have a complex system, running virtual machines inside
 a hypervisor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that all IO requests of the application will not only go through
 the filesystem, but also through the buffer / page cache.
 The in-memory cache will usually serve most IO requests from the application,
 without causing physical IO at the block layer (so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cache hits
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On some well-tuned production servers, it is no problem to achieve cache
 hit rates of 99% or more, leading to a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gear ratio
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 1:100, or even 1:1000 (in long-term runs).
 Of course, there also exist heavy workloads running on thin servers, where
 sometimes less than 1:10 can be achieved.
 Even in that case, there will be 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 some cache hits, for example caused by metadata requests from the filesystem.
 In practice, the cache hit rate will never go down to 0%.
 Notice that these inevitable cache effects are 
\emph on
already included
\emph default
 in any 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now look at the situation in the laboratory.
 The application and the filesystem is no longer present, but its 
\emph on
effects
\emph default
 are simulated by 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
.
 Due to the architecture of the Linux kernel, all IO requests will continue
 to run through the buffer cache
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Several commercial Unices used a concept called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

raw device
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which circumvented their buffer cache.
 In contrast, the internal structures of Linux device driver are internally
 interwoven with the page cache in a rather sticky way.
 Instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

raw devices
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Linux uses the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

direct IO
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which 
\emph on
tries
\emph default
 to minimize any caching effects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be clear by the very nature of our experiment, that at measuring
 point B 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 the same events 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 happen as had been formerly observed / recorded at point A.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the page / buffer cache of the laboratory system 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 be switched off.
 Otherwise, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gear ratio
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 1:10 (or let it be only 1:1.1) would lead to distortions of the measurement
 results.
 In order to switch off the page / buffer cache, 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 uses 
\family typewriter
O_DIRECT
\family default
 mode as offered by the Linux kernel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that even by these measures, there may remain some subtle differences
 between the operations occurring at point A and point B.
 The block layer of the Linux kernel does some optimizations, for example
 it tries to 
\emph on
coalesce
\emph default
 adjacent requests, or to 
\emph on
split
\emph default
 some requests, depending on the capabilities of the hardware.
 Usually, these are minor modifications, occurring at less than 1% of all
 requests.
 However, keep in mind (and check) these effects.

 The

elevator strategy

 (aka IO scheduler) of the Linux block layer is a bigger influence factor.
 It can

 requests, and it can even add

artificial latencies

 For example,

Pure timely overlapping (without positionly overlapping) is a frequent case
 in almost any IO system (usually called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

IO parallelism
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in folklore).
 In opposite, purely positionly overlapping (without timely overlapping)
 is also a frequent case, for example when the same sector is re-read after
 a while, or re-written when the contents of a file changes frequently.
 Completely unrelated requests (neither timely nor positionly overlapping)
 are probably the most frequent case in most practical load scenarios at
 production sites.
 There is no problem with any of them, indicated by the checkmarks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, what about both kinds of overlapping at the same time?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case of 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 timely and positionly overlapping (simultanously) of IO operations is called
 
\emph on
damaged IO
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In ordinary OS kernels, damaged IO usually 
\emph on
never
\emph default
 occurs.
 Here are the reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IO requests are usually generated by in-kernel memory caches like buffer
 caches or page caches.
 Even in case of databases using Direct IO when submitting requests to the
 block layer, their internal database buffer cache works similarly to in-kernel
 caches.
 It simply makes 
\emph on
no sense
\emph default
 to write to the same sector twice at the same time, because the result
 will be undefined.
 A similar argument holds for reads in parallel to writes to/from the same
 sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory, concurrent reads from the same sector would be possible without
 causing harm to data integrity on the block device.
 In operating system caches, this would introduce 
\emph on
copies
\emph default
 of the same data into the buffer or page cache, violating its internal
 
\emph on
uniqueness
\emph default
 properties stating that any sector is cached at most once.
 Consequently, this case also never appears 
\emph on
in practice
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
real-life systems(!)
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, in terms of 
\series bold
correctness of storage semantics
\series default
 the case of damaged IO involving read/read to the same sector is 
\emph on
allowed
\emph default
.
 Probably you already know the following table from database textbooks and

\noindent
Some block IO systems like DRBD show some misbehaviour in case of concurrent
 writes to the same sector, or in some cases they even fail.
 Some DRBD versions
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At present, this seems to be an undocumented behaviour observed by the author.
 Even if DRBD's behaviour may change in the future: damaged IO is a bad
 idea by itself.
 It would be unfair to blame DRBD for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

psychologically unexpected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 behaviour under illegal load patterns, which should never occur.
 In general, making code rubust against damaged IO could decrease performance
 during ordinary operation.
 Thus damaged IO should be avoided at its 
\emph on
source
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 will at least delay further IO requests for several milliseconds, lowering
 IO bandwidth or even leading to temporary hangs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, damaged IO 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 be avoided under all circumstances.
 Failing to do so may result in a disaster; in general, some IO devices
 like elder tape drives may even be corrupted as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While avoidance of damaged IO is automatically guaranteed in real production
 systems by the buffer / cache page of the Linux kernel (or other components
 like database memory buffers), our tool 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 must be designed very carefully not to step into that pitfall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is there a risk that 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 could (accidentally) start some damaged IO?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, replay of the original timing of requests is not always possible.
 Even if 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 
\emph on
tries
\emph default
 to start IO requests in the same timely pattern as at the original site,
 a very slow device (or a heavily overloaded device) may delay an IO operation
 for a very long time.
 In overload scenarios, or in case of iSCSI network hangs, it is possible
 that some IO requests may take 5 minutes to complete (or even more, or
 even 
\emph on
never
\emph default
 complete in case of fatal errors).
 In such cases, it is not unlikely that a new write to the same sector is
 started before the old one has completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to avoid damaged IO, 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 uses some in-memory hash tables to detect any (potential) conflicts between
 IO requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to deal with (potential) problems caused by damaged IO, we use
 the following options in 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 to control its behaviour at

 This has the lowest overhead of all conflict-avoiding methods.
 Depending on properties of the load, the number of dropped requests may

 This results in a reordering of the

Verification of Storage Semantics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to allow verification of the sector headers and their timestamps
 / version stamps, 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 needs some temporary storage where information can be kept for a longer
 time than just during IO.
 Two temporary files are used: 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/tmp/verify_table
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/tmp/completion_table
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
.
 Both are sparse files, containing a simple (sparse) array of sequence numbers,
 indexed by the position (sector#).
 Whenever a write is started, a new sequence number is recorded in 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/tmp/verify_table
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
.
 Whenever that write is completed, the same number is recorded in 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/tmp/completion_table
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
.
 At any time, both tables keep track of the current progress of write operations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever the sequence numbers at the same position (sector#) are different
 between both files, we know that a write operation has not yet completed.
 If they are the same, we know which sequence number should appear in the
 header of the corresponding sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are following variants of verification modes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
--with-verify
\family default
 Whenever a sector is read (by a regular read request) which has been written
 before (by an ordinary write request), the read data is checked against
 the sequence numbers from the tables.
 Any mismatches are reported by the string 
\family typewriter
VERIFY ERROR
\family default
 in the result file.
 Thus, 
\family typewriter
zgrep 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\family default
 will show them to you.
 In addition, the statistics section at the end of the output file will
 contain some valuable information.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Warning! this mode can only reveal errors in the storage semantics if written
 blocks are re-read somewhen.
 When sectors are just written, but never read, this mode will not detect
 anything.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

 All verify modes will create temporary tables in

 In the following simplified

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For simplicity, this example assumes that the address translation uses the

We start with an empty logical address space (often called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logical volume
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, shortly LV), having a logical size of several terabytes.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that initially 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 assignment between logical and physical sector numbers exists.
 Now we start a short benchmark (whether 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 or others like 
\family typewriter
iometer
\family default
).
 When request #1 (a write) arrives, no physical location exists yet.
 Therefore, a new location must be assigned.
 In this example, the locations are always taken from the beginning of the
 physical address space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, all the physical sectors occurring in this example will be allocated
 in a very small and compact area at the start of the physical address space.
 Imagine the drawing not being true to scale: imagine a total size of several
 terabytes (
\begin_inset Formula $>10^{9}$
\end_inset

 sectors), and a 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 benchmark touching only a few thousands of sectors.
 What will be the effect?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Only a 
\emph on
tiny
\emph default
 fraction of the physical space will be actually used, usually less than
 one per mille or even less than a millionth.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In contrast, real world applications as well as real customers tend to use
 up significant space with real data, usually more than 50% (and up to 100%).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Even if accesses to the LV are (pseudo-)random, accesses to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 remain random: as you can see, they are translated to (purely / almost)
 
\emph on
sequential
\emph default
 access patterns.
 If the physical addresses are residing on a mechanical hard disk, (almost)
 no seek operations will occur.
 Additionally, the physical operations are in 
\emph on
ascending
\emph default
 order, which is a classical use case for BBU-cached writes and/or readahead
 strategies.
 Notice that ascending sequential IO on hard disks is usually faster than
 random IO by a factor of 100 or even more (depending on hardware and further
 factors like RAID, between one and three orders of magnitude).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In contrast, real-world writes will be spreaded much more randomly over
 the physical partition, and there will be a significant amount of

 in many practical use cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Even worse, read requests need not be mapped at all (indicated by shading

Now assume that the LV has a size of several terabytes, and the workload
 is operating on a large part of that.
 On one hand, this is several orders of magnitude larger than the upper
 cache, but on the other hand typical application workloads will not access
 all sectors with the same uniform probability.
 In general, caches are only useful in two cases (non-exclusively):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the cache is strictly larger than the workload.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the workload contains unevenly distributed access frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Case 1 occurs only in special cases, such as in-memory databases (or workstation
 loads on large RAM machines).
 Case 2 appears more often.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back to the above example: assume that only case 2 applies to the upper
 cache.
 Consequently, case 2 will also apply to the lower cache, because the lower

 As a consequence from LRU (or any other strategy avoiding anomalies

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 As a further consequence, we see that the lower cache is superfluous: by

 due to less overhead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What can we do about that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simply, just design your system in such a way that lower caches are always
 strictly larger than higher ones, by a factor of

 In order to be useful, 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq2$

Probably you already know this, and you think you don't violate it.
 However, it is possible you might violate it unwillingly.
 The standard case is a server from a data center, equipped with several
 gigabytes of RAM.
 Almost all of the main memory can be used by the buffer/page caches of
 the Linux kernel.
 Therefore, you already may have a rather large upper cache you didn't think

 As a consequence, caches at the block storage level (e.g.
 SSD caches etc) should be larger by an order of magnitude (in this case

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The workingset theory has been developped by Denning in the late 1960s,
 and has been originally used for the description of the behaviour of hardware-M
MU-based paging / swapping systems and their strategies like LRU.
 It is also useful in other areas, such as block storage.
 Here is an adaptation of Denning's theory to our needs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
WS(t,\delta)=\big\{\text{{set\,\ of\,\ all\,\ sectors\,\ touched\,\ in\,\ the\,\ time\,\ interval\,[t-\delta,t]}}\big\}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Usually, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is treated as a constant, called 
\emph on
window size
\emph default
.
 Then the workingset 
\begin_inset Formula $WS(t,\delta)$
\end_inset

 at some point in time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is simply the set of sectors occurring in a 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 during a time window of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 seconds 
\emph on
before
\emph default

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice: Dennings original theory used the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[t,t+\delta].$
\end_inset

We find our definition more handy for practical purposes, because we need
 no

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 the interesting point in time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Notice that we have a 
\emph on
set
\emph default
 here: it makes no difference how often a particular sector occurs during
 the time window 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta,$
\end_inset

 it just matters 
\emph on
whether
\emph default
 that sector appears or not.
 Also, it makes no difference whether a particular sector is read or written
 (or both).
 Thus the workingset model is a 
\emph on
reduction
\emph default
 of the reality to a handy theoretical model, but a model which is known
 to 
\emph on
preserve
\emph default
 some relevant and very interesting properties of the reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: for any two window sizes 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{1}<\delta_{2},$
\end_inset

 the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $WS(t,\delta_{1})\leq WS(t,\delta_{2})$
\end_inset

 holds at any point in time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 In other words: increasing the window size 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 will never make the workingset smaller; the workingset can only 
\emph on
grow
\emph default
 if the window becomes larger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The efficiency of block storage caches can be predicted by the workingset
 theory in a rather easy and intuitive way.
 We assume that accesses to the cache are 
\emph on
much faster
\emph default
 than accesses to the background storage, such that we can 
\emph on
neglect
\emph default
 the access times to the cache when compared to accesses to the background
 storage.
 Then we can model the following interesting property:

\begin_layout Quote

 the following condition holds:
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_inset Formula $|WS(t,\delta)|\leq|\text{{cachesize}}|$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\geq(\text{{time\,\ to\,\ fill\,\ the\,\ cache\,\ once}})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The potential painpoint is easy to see: just take 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 as the time to fill the cache from the background storage, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $(\text{{accesstime\,\ to\,\ storage}})\star(\text{{cachesize}})$
\end_inset

.
 If there would exist a point in time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 where the workingset 
\begin_inset Formula $WS(t,\delta)$
\end_inset

 would be 
\emph on

 than could be transferred to/from the storage during that 
\emph on
same

 time window 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$

\emph on

\emph default

 Vice versa: if the workingset during window

 The latter assures that

Example: the original

 Since in the lab we had only a smaller system with 4 TB,

 Whenever

 As a side effect, this will also influence the maximum number of outstanding

\begin_layout Standard
Many people believe that an increasing number of outstanding IO requests

\begin_layout Standard
However, some devices / drivers / IO schedulers may respond in some

 Sometimes, your throughput can even

 There are many possible reasons for this unexpected behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most cases, you will notice collapsing effects only during

 During normal operation, you will not notice anything, because the device

 There are almost no queues, because the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as the device gets overloaded, the situation will change rapidly.
 Masses of 
\family typewriter

\family default
 threads are trying to fire off their requests in time, starting to overlap
 now because the service time increases.
 Suddenly, some queuing will take place, somewhere.
 In mathematical theory, the queue lengths could even grow indefinitely

 In practice, there will be some limits somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine you are going shopping in a supermarket.
 When the cashier girl cannot catch up with the demand from the customers,

 Now assume the following behaviour: the longer the queue, the

 Imagine that! After a while, customer satisfaction will go down to zero,

 And the longer, the slower she will work.

 There is no escape, other than stopping to buy anything from there.

\begin_layout Standard
A similar behaviour can be observed in some IO systems.
 Once a queue has formed, there is almost no escape from a behaviour similar

 In reality, the number of outstanding requests is often limited in some
 way.
 For example, a typical workstation load caused by a single user has often
 some intrinsically limited IO parallelism, similar to a limited number

 On the other hand, some server loads (such as those caused by Apache) can

 In addition, some experience with 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 is helpful.
 In order to gain such experience, consider a 
\emph on
test project
\emph default
 just for playing around, and for getting familiar with the pitfalls.

\begin_layout Standard
Before starting, you should get conscious with yourself.
 
\emph on
What exactly
\emph default
 is the question you want to answer with help of 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Write down the question both as shortly, as well as precisely as possible.
 Here are some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
Next, write down a precise description of your intended

test environment
\series default
.
 Best practice is to name hardware vendors, models, all components (including
 intermediate gear like network switches), and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last step: describe all the parameters which know of, which

could
\emph default
 have an influence onto your test results.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Describe the Setup of your Experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases, the parameters described in your table will make up a multi-dimen
sional problem space (cartesian product) which is too large to be explored
 exhaustively.
 As explained in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Pitfalls-from-Replay"

\end_inset

, many of them will influence your results 
\emph on
non-linearly
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, you will have to consider the following general strategies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may fix some of the parameters to particular values.
 Although this saves time, you may miss an opportunity to find an optimal
 solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may select some/enough random samples from your multi-dimensional problem
 space and try them randomly (Monte Carlo methods).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Stepwise refinement: explore the multidimensional space by varying exactly
 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 paramenter at once.
 This is slow, but you can be sure of the effects caused by this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Select 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 Load
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Select-blkreplay-Load"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on your project, you should consider both artificial and natural
 loads, but not too many of them.
 Usually, more than three loads are impractical for an ambitious project
 (unless you want to compare masses of loads on the same reference hardware).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your project tries to answer a question for some specific workload X,
 you should just record that workload if you can do so (see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:How-to-use"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you cannot obtain your real workload in advance, you have to select one
 from the 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 project (or other sources) which comes as close as possible to your (intended)
 natural workload.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the sake of static comparison of workloads, 
\family typewriter
cd
\family default
 to a directory containing your 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
 files and issue the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
/path/to/graph.sh --static myname.load.gz
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will produce some 
\family typewriter
.png
\family default
 graphics, describing the throughput and workingset behaviour of your load
 (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Pitfalls-from-Workingset"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 You need enough space in 
\family typewriter
/tmp/
\family default
 (or in another 
\family typewriter
$TMPDIR
\family default
) for temporary intermediate files.
 If your 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
 file is very large (several hours or even days), you may need several gigabytes.
 Please don't interrupt 
\family typewriter
graph.sh
\family default
 as it spawns lots of subprocesses and creates lots of temporary files.
 Currently, there are no checks for free space in 
\family typewriter
/tmp/
\family default
, so running out of space may produce wrong results 
\emph on
silently
\emph default
.
 As a countermeasure, run 
\family typewriter
watch df /tmp/
\family default
 in a separate window during your run of 
\family typewriter
graph.sh
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: some 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 recordings (but not all) contain some timing information about the original
 IO latencies as measured at the original site.
 Use 
\family typewriter
/path/to/graph.sh --dynamic myname.load.gz
\family default
 to create some additional graphics about them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Selection of Replay Duration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a hairy problem, as already described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Pitfalls-from-Workingset"

\end_inset

.
 Often, you cannot run 24h replays for many hundred times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to be sure that a particular load will run even under 
\emph on
worst-case
\emph default
 conditions, you should definitly select some appropriate time window around
 
\emph on
load peaks
\emph default
, measured both in throughput as well as in workingset size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, you can try the following strategies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For explorative phases in your project, such as determining the optimum
 in your parameter space, you can try to minimize running times as much
 as possible.
 But not too much.
 Otherwise you will be caught by the pitfalls described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:How-to-Avoid"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For final verification of your results, you should repeat benchmarks with
 a longer window (at least 8h or 24h).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Total Project Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Working with huge parameter spaces is not all you have to consider.
 Setup of different RAID levels, re-initialization after changes of stripe
 sizes, filling LVs with random data, etc, may take a very long time, in
 addition to the benchmark themselves.
 Don't forget that! Your only chance are nights and weekends, if you manage
 to run something unattendedly.
 But predictions are sometimes wrong.
 In addition, something may fail and then needs to be restarted.
 Calculate some spare time for that!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is a high time pressure in the project timeline, you probably will
 have to 
\emph on
rework
\emph default
 some parts of your project plan.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Graphics

 Planning is crucial! When you find any discrepancies, try to re-think your
 plan as a whole, not just some parts of it.

Setup Phase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lab setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ensure that all your hard- and software components are ready in the lab
 and operational.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, you need some workstation (or server) where the 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 suite is checked out.
 Do the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ensure that 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
make
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
gnuplot
\family default
, and some standard tools like 
\family typewriter
grep
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
gawk
\family default
 are installed.
 If you need multiple machine architectures (such as 
\family typewriter
x86_64
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
i386
\family default
) in parallel, ensure that 
\family typewriter
gcc
\family default
 can cross-compile via flags 
\family typewriter
-m32
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
-m64
\family default
 and that the appropriate libs are installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
git clone https://github.com/schoebel/blkreplay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
cd blkreplay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize
Attention! 
\family typewriter
make install

 Just leave everything in place.
 You can either put

\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/path/to/blkreplay/scripts/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
 into your 
\family typewriter
$PATH
\family default
, or call the scripts via hard path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ensure that all your test machines are reachable as 
\family typewriter
root
\family default
 via 
\family typewriter
ssh
\family default
 from your central workplace, without need for any password prompt.
 In order to achieve that, you should consider 
\family typewriter
ssh-agent
\family default
, in addition so some tweaking of 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/etc/ssh/ssh_config
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (and probably 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/etc/ssh/sshd_config
\end_layout

\end_inset

 on each of the target hosts).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On your workstation, you should have enough disk space to store your results.
 Create a subdirectory there for your project.
 Copy 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/path/to/blkreplay/example-run/default-main.conf
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (and possibly other 
\family typewriter
*.conf
\family default
 files) to that new subdirectory, and finally 
\family typewriter
cd
\family default
 to it.
 For the rest of your life, you will be working there ;)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can now either call 
\family typewriter
/path/to/blkreplay/scripts/
\emph on
something
\emph default
.sh
\family default
 as hard paths as indicated in the following examples, or you may put 
\family typewriter
/path/to/blkreplay/scripts/
\family default
 into your 
\family typewriter
$PATH
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Customization of 
\family typewriter
default-main.conf
\family default
 is described in the following.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Configuration Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should edit 
\family typewriter
default-main.conf
\family default
 to reflect the default setup for your project.
 If you want to run multiple variants of your default setup, you can do
 so by creating additional files like 
\family typewriter
\emph on
something
\emph default
.conf
\family default
 as well as a subdirectory 
\family typewriter
\emph on
something
\emph default
/
\family default
 (having the same name without suffix 
\family typewriter
.conf
\family default
).
 When you later start your benchmark, the values from 
\family typewriter
\emph on
something
\emph default
.conf
\family default
 will override those from 
\family typewriter
default-main.conf
\family default
.
 It is highly recommended to override only 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 parameter inside 
\family typewriter
\emph on
something
\emph default
.conf
\family default
, otherwise it may become difficult to reveal the real impact of changed
 parameters onto your test candidate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, you may override 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 parameter from 
\family typewriter
default-main.conf
\family default
, even hostnames, or input files 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
, or whatever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Meaning of the Config File Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meaning of the parameters is documented in the following places:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Comments inside 
\family typewriter
default-main.conf
\family default
 should provide enough information for experienced administrators, at least
 for a quick start, and should guide you through the most basic steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The same information is available in appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Config-File-Parameters"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Last but not least: read the sources, if you are in doubt about anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Benchmark Phase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea is simple: after customization of 
\family typewriter
default-main.conf
\family default
 (and probably other 
\family typewriter
default-*.conf
\family default
 files when using additional modules), you create a new subdirectory for
 each benchmark run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever you call 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/path/to/blkreplay/scripts/tree-replay.sh
\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
 (without parameters), a whole bundle of benchmarks will be started, one
 for each 
\emph on
leaf
\emph default

\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A leaf has no further subtree inside it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 subdirectory (starting from 
\family typewriter
cwd
\family default
), provided that for each (intermedidate) subdirectory name 
\family typewriter
\emph on
xxx
\family default
\emph default
 there exists some 
\family typewriter
\emph on
xxx
\emph default
.conf
\family default
 in the current working directory or in one of its parents.
 In the whole subdirectory structure, any directory ending with 
\family typewriter
.old
\family default
, or including the substring 
\family typewriter
ignore
\family default
, or containg a file 
\family typewriter
skip
\family default
 will be ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Example: you have created a subdirectory 
\family typewriter
./short/
\family default
 as well as two nested subdirectories 
\family typewriter
./short/model1/
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
./short/model2/
\family default
.
 You further have prepared the config files 
\family typewriter
short.conf
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
model1.conf
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
model2.conf
\family default
, existing in the current working directory or in some parent directory
 down the 
\family typewriter
../
\family default
 chain.
 Then exactly 
\emph on
two
\emph default
 benchmark runs will be started, namely in 
\family typewriter
./short/model1/
\family default
 and in 
\family typewriter
./short/model2/
\family default
.
 The benchmark running in 
\family typewriter
./short/model1/
\family default
 will include the following 
\family typewriter
*.conf
\family default
 files, in the following order: 
\family typewriter
default-main.conf
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
short.conf
\family default
, and finally 
\family typewriter
model1.conf
\family default
.
 Each of the specialized config files may override any previous setting,
 but it is highly recommended to change only one parameter at a time and
 to use short but expressive names.
 Notice: the intermediate directory 
\family typewriter
./short/
\family default
 is no leaf (since it contains some subdirectories), therefore no benchmark
 will be started inside it.
 Later, you just need to create 
\family typewriter
./long/
\family default
 as well as 
\family typewriter
./long/model1/
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
./long/model2/
\family default
 and some 
\family typewriter
long.conf
\family default
 in order to repeat the same benchmarks with a longer 
\family typewriter
replay_duration
\family default
 setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intuitive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 names like 
\family typewriter
short
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
long
\family default
 bears some danger.
 A few years later, you will not remember what they exactly have meant.
 Looking into 
\family typewriter
*.conf
\family default
 will not help other people, for example if you publish your benchmark results
 somewhere.
 Therefore it may be wise to use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

speaking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 names like 
\family typewriter
duration_600
\family default
, at least if you have more than two variants.
 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intuitive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 names are better for presentation to some less-deeply involved audience.
 Take some time for creating well-designed names for 
\family typewriter
*.conf
\family default
 and your directory hierarchy! Changing that names later is cumbersome.
 Better to design your names in advance in a systematic (but simple) way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On large investigation projects, deeply nested structures may be necessary,
 involving different loads, different hardware, different hardware setup,
 etc.
 Not all of them are currently automated.
 You can use the generic module mechanism to extend the default scripts
 with further functionality, to push automation further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, not all setup tasks 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be automated at all.
 Some of them like forcing physical RAID degradation must be started by
 physically removing a disk, which cannot be automated (other than buying
 extremely expensive robots).
 Therefore, you may include some human-readable dialogs inside your 
\family typewriter
*.conf
\family default
 files (in shell script syntax), or in some new modules you have written.
 In any case, it is advisable to write some script code to 
\emph on
check some preconditions
\emph default
 (such as RAID status) in order to prevent wrong measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, 
\family typewriter
tree-replay.sh
\family default
 will never repeat any benchmark which has already completed (i.e.
 there exists an output file 
\family typewriter
*.replay.gz
\family default
 in that leaf directory).
 This allows an incremental style of working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Continued
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

example: normally, you can call 
\family typewriter
tree-replay.sh
\family default
 again, but nothing happens, because all leaf directories already contain
 some results.
 However, then you find a problem with the results in 
\family typewriter
./short/model1/
\family default
, so you want to repeat that benchmark without deleting your first (questionable
) results.
 Now you create a subdirectory 
\family typewriter
./short/model1/try1.old/
\family default
 and move your results there.
 As said above, any directory names ending with 
\family typewriter
.old
\family default
 or containing the substring 
\family typewriter
ignore
\family default
 are ignored, so the directory 
\family typewriter
./short/model1/
\family default
 will continue to count as a leaf (despite its newer subdirectory, which
 is just ignored).
 Since the 
\family typewriter
*.replay.gz
\family default
 files are now missing in 
\family typewriter
./short/model1/
\family default
 due to the 
\family typewriter
mv
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
tree-replay.sh
\family default
 will repeat that single benchmark there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some useful hints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may skip any directory by creating a file 
\family typewriter
skip
\family default
 inside it.
 
\family typewriter
touch ./short/model1/skip
\family default
 will disable that directory.
 Later, you can remove that file in order to fire off that benchmark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
skip
\family default
 files are also working in intermediate directories like 
\family typewriter
./short/
\family default
, disabling the whole subtree in one step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design your 
\family typewriter
*.conf
\family default
 files such that arbitrary combinations are 
\emph on
possible
\emph default
 (cartesian product).
 In contrast, your directory hierarchy need not (and, in many cases, 
\emph on
will not
\emph default
) exploit the 
\emph on
full
\emph default
 cartesian product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may create a new leaf directory (somewhere in the subtree) even in parallel
 to an already running benchmark.
 Whenever the currently running benchmark has completed, 
\family typewriter
tree-replay.sh
\family default
 will re-scan the subdirectory structure, find any freshly created leaf
 directories, and determine which benchmark to start next.
 All leaf directory names which have not yet completed are sorted alphabetically
, and the first name according to ASCII sort order is taken first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When 10 or more variants could appear somewhere (even after a while), use
 leading zeros in any names like 
\family typewriter
v001
\family default

Sometimes the ASCII sort order of names like 
\family typewriter
short
\family default
 vs 
\family typewriter
long
\family default
 is boring, because you want to run the 
\family typewriter
short
\family default
 benchmarks first.
 As a workaround in larger projects, add some numerical prefixes like in
 
\family typewriter
01_short
\family default
 vs 
\family typewriter
09_long
\family default
 (leaving some numerical space such that you can later add 
\family typewriter
05_medium
\family default
).
 As a side effect, this also improves the ASCII sort order of your later
 
\family typewriter
*.png
\family default
 graphics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can rearrange the order in another way: just create an empty file 
\family typewriter
prio-nnn
\family default
 in a leaf directory, where 
\family typewriter
nnn
\family default
 is a number denoting a priority class.
 Priority classes are overriding the global ASCII sort order.
 Directories having the lowest priority class are run first, while directories
 without any class are run last.
 Inside of each class, the ASCII sort order is obeyed.

\begin_layout Itemize
When you design your

 whether you permute some directory components (e.g 
\family typewriter

\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
./short/model1/
\family default
).
 However, in practice it influences the ASCII sort order (taking the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When some benchmark fails, just delete the corresponding output files.

 However, only the

A turn is a request where the sector number is

 than the sector number of its predecessor.
 For a mechanical hard disk, a turn means that it has to

 Imagine an old-fashioned magnetic tape (e.g.
 DAT), then you will get some feeling for the meaning of a turn.
 Turns are an interesting measure for the locality behaviour of the load
 (or the replay result).
 There is no freak that some IO schedulers try to minimize the number of
 turns (for example the famous sawtooth strategy).
 In this graphics, the y axis shows the

As already explained, delays are the difference between the

 Huge delays are almost always an indication that the system cannot

catch up

\end_inset

 with the application demands.
 Here is an example:

Here is a list of already existing modules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
iscsi_target_iet
\family default
 When enabled, your 
\family typewriter
iet
\family default
 iSCSI target will be automatically configured for you, automatically generating
 iSCSI 
\family typewriter
IQN
\family default
 names for you.
 Usually this module is used in combination with 
\family typewriter
iscsi_initiator
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
iscsi_initiator
\family default
 When enabled, your 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 runs will automatically act on iSCSI 
\family typewriter
IQN
\family default
 identifiers instead of on device names, transparently creating iSCSI connection
s for you.
 It can be used standalone, for example to connect to commercial storage
 boxes.
 When combined with module 
\family typewriter
iscsi_target_
\family default
*, even the 
\family typewriter
IQN
\family default
 name generation will be automated transparently (in this case you just
 supply the device names present at the 
\family typewriter
iscsi_target
\family default
 host).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
recreate_lvm
\family default
 You just supply some physical devices (PVs) in 
\family typewriter
$replay_device_list
\family default
, and this module will transparently (re-)create an LVM volume group (VG)
 for you, together with some configurable number of logical volumes (LVs)
 inside it, optionally even with LVM striping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

pipe_*
\family default
 When enabled, these filtering modules modify the

\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
.
 Following pipe filters are available:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
pipe_repeat
\family default
 Repeat the same input files forever, or until 
\family typewriter
$replay_duration
\family default
 is reached.
 This is useful if your 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
 is too short for a longer replay.
 However keep in mind that the 
\emph on
workingset
\emph default
 will not increase, because exactly the 
\emph on
same
\emph default
 IO operations will be repeated after a while.
 In order to circumvent that, combine this module with 
\family typewriter
pipe_slip
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
pipe_slip
\family default
 Add some offset to the sector# after a bunch of operations.
 Use this in combination with 
\family typewriter
pipe_repeat
\family default
 to produce a

\begin_layout Standard
In order to write your own module, just look at the existing ones and take
 them as a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

template
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Modules are simply 
\family typewriter
/bin/bash
\family default
 code residing in 
\family typewriter
scripts/modules/
\family default
 and starting with a number
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The number is used to determine the ASCII sort order, and thus the order

\end_layout

\end_inset

, followed by an underscore, and finally 
\family typewriter
\emph on
modulename
\emph default
.sh
\family default
.
 Any existing module is automatically 
\family typewriter
source
\family default
d by 
\family typewriter
tree-replay.sh
\family default
, provided that some config file 
\family typewriter
default-
\emph on
modulename
\emph default
.conf
\family default
 exists in your working directory (or in any parent directory down the 
\family typewriter
../
\family default
 path).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modules are sourced only once at the start of 
\family typewriter
tree-replay.sh
\family default
.
 Thus they should only define some shell 
\family typewriter
function
\family default
s and change some list variables.
 The shell functions will be called later for each leaf directory.
 The names of your functions should obey the following conventions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
\emph on
modulename
\emph default
_prepare()
\family default
 is called during the preparation phase.
 Typically, you can set some variables here, initialize some controllers,
 setup your network, create some iSCSI connections, or the like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
\emph on
modulename
\emph default
_setup()
\family default
 The setup phase starts after 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 prepare functions of all modules have been executed.
 For example, some device setup operations are only possible after some
 iSCSI connections have been already established.
 Therefore, the plugin methodology offers you a separate phase in order
 to guarantee some overall order on operations even from unknown foreign
 modules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
\emph on
modulename
\emph default
_run()
\family default
 Typically, you won't do anything here, because the running phase is usually
 the task of the 
\family typewriter
main
\family default
 module.
 Only in very special cases, you would need to hook yourself into this phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
\emph on
modulename
\emph default
_cleanup()
\family default
 Typically, you will de-configure something here, remove some temporary

\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
\emph on
modulename
\emph default
_finish()
\family default
 Typically, network connections etc will be shutdown only here, because
 some operations from the cleanup phase could be relying on them being active
 yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each phase, there exists a variable 
\family typewriter
\emph on
phasename
\emph default
_list
\family default
 determining the order in which the functions will be called.
 In most cases, you will just 
\emph on
append
\emph default
 your function name to that list.
 In some cases, you may want to 
\emph on
pre
\emph default
pend instead.
 Look into the existing code of small modules like 
\family typewriter

Internal Overhead
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some new SSDs are promising IO rates of more than 100.000 IOPS when operated
 over extremely fast IO channels.
 When you try to achieve such high rates, you may probably stumble over
 several difficulties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, running too much threads / processes on the same file handle
 or on the same pipe can lead to serious lock contention in the Linux kernel,
 limiting overall throughput.
 Although some people might argue that 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 itself could produce an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

artificial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 bottleneck, please keep in mind that you need some 
\emph on
real applications
\emph default
 which were capable of producing / consuming such extremely high IO traffic.
 Real applications usually don't use AIO, where such problems occur less
 frequently.
 No wonder that benchmark results published on the internet are often based
 on AIO, which is far from practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, here is some advice how to deal with extremely high IO traffic.
 For 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 IO rates in the region of a few 10.000, the following is usually not needed.
 Otherwise, you should be prepared to look into internals of the kernel,
 compile your own high-speed custom kernels with some debugging options
 switched off / better tuning of schedulers etc, and possibly use tools
 like 
\family typewriter
oprofile
\family default
 to check what is really going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to determine the internal overhead of 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
, play around with the following parameters:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
--threads=\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default
 (or 
\family typewriter
threads=\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default
 as a shell variable in 
\family typewriter
*.conf
\family default
) The most important setting.
 Although counter-intuitive, too high numbers of threads may increase the
 overall overhead and thus reduce throughput.
 Be prepared to degrade this to rather low numbers in order to really achieve
 extremely high IO throughput.
 Usually, no more than 32 should be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
--dry-run
\family default
 (or, as a shell variable, 
\family typewriter
dry_run
\family default
 with underscore instead of minus) Omit any 
\family typewriter
read()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
write()
\family default
 operations, but continue to use 
\family typewriter
lseek64()
\family default
 on the file handles.
 This way, you can determine the internal overhead in isolation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
--fake-io
\family default
 Additionally omit even 
\family typewriter
lseek64()
\family default
 operations, as well as creation of header data.
 Compare results with 
\family typewriter
--dry-run
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
--fan-out=\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default
 In order to reduce parallelism on 
\family typewriter
pipe()
\family default
 channels, 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 spawns internal distributor threads, forming a tree with limited fan-out
 degree.
 Too high numbers will increase pipe overhead, while too low numbers will
 increase thread and scheduling overhead.
 The optimum may depend on hardware (e.g.
 NUMA) and kernel version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
--no-dispatcher
\family default
 Omit distributor threads for the answer channels completely.
 When combined with high numbers of threads, this may increase the kernel
 overhead to almost unusable regions.
 Use this for kernel tuning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
--bottleneck=\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default
 Limit the number of flying IO requests.
 Has a similar effect than 
\family typewriter
--threads
\family default
, but is not the same.
 Can be used for determining internal kernel and even hardware overheads
 such as TLB thrashing (e.g.
 by keeping 
\family typewriter
--bottleneck
\family default
 constant and increasing 
\family typewriter
--threads
\family default
).
 Could be useful for kernel and hardware tuning.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold
Hint:
\series default
 you can even set this to much higher numbers than 
\family typewriter
--threads
\family default
, in order to pre-fill the communication pipes with some ahead requests
 (minimizing the risk of waiting times).
 However, when the number is way too high, a 
\emph on
coprocess deadlock
\emph default
 could occur (see the literature about coprocesses).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family typewriter
--speedup=\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default
 A very dangerous option when used with natural loads.
 Leads to heavy distortions of the relationship between timely and positionly
 behaviour; in essence 
\emph on
a natural load will not remain a natural load any more
\emph default
.
 For artificial loads, however, such as 
\family typewriter
*bursts*
\family default
, it is useful to reach top IOPS regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, extremely high IOPS rates are likely to be reached only by
 running multiple 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 instances in parallel.

The tool

 Here are some additions from a practical viewpoint of IT operations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You will need a kernel with compile-time option 
\family typewriter
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IO_TRACE
\family default
 enabled.
 Although many newer Linux distros have it already enabled by default, you
 may stumble over elder systems / distributions where it was missing (so
 you may need to install and/or recompile a different kernel).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Please note that some 
\family typewriter
man
\family default
 pages about 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 contain unclear / misleading information about the physical unit of the
 
\family typewriter
-b
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
--buffer-size
\family default
 option, which may lead to serious problems (including kernel hangups /
 crashes) if you (accidentally) try to allocate more kernel memory than
 physically available, and/or your production server is heavily loaded.
 Unless you are recording extremely high-performance loads, the default
 settings will succeed; so there will be no risk for IT operations.

 You should seriously consider renaming it to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result file will contain as much IO requests as the script could find
 in the 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 recording, but it will not contain any original timings (durations of the
 requests, aka latencies).
 The latency column is simply set to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0$
\end_inset

 everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a reason for it.
 Extracting timing information 
\emph on
reliably
\emph default
 from a 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 recording is difficult.
 The problem is that each driver / subsystem in den kernel uses different
 trace action characters to indicate the start of an IO request (as well
 as for indicating various intermediate stages of request processing).
 Request completion is 
\emph on
another
\emph default
 event denoted by character '
\family typewriter
C
\family default
'.
 Depending on kernel version / driver, the completion events may be even
 missing at all (some devices on very old kernels, which nevertheless occur
 in practice).
 More seriously, it is a hard task to determine pairs of events, i.e.
 determining which completion event belongs to which submission event.
 There is no concept of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

request ID
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which would allow this easily.
 You have to guess matching pairs from their sector numbers / length etc.
 Guessing may be wrong due to ambiguities.
 In general, a completion could sometimes even belong to multiple submission
 events.
 In addition, when you start and/or end your 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 recording at a heavily loaded 
\emph on
production
\emph default
 server (which is just the most interesting case), some pairs will very
 likely remain incomplete at the start and at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 circumstances, we found many cases where non-matching events led to an
 incomplete 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
 result.
 Therefore we decided to omit timings from our default conversion script,
 at least for now
\begin_inset Foot

 However, there is another script which tries to

 the timings as best as it can:

The latter script will name its output

 which is different from the former one.
 There is a reason for it.

 The load is linearly increasing over time, until the test candidate will

collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 under the overload.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use a single

Here is the sonar diagram for the SATA system.
 It 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

At the beginning, the load is rather low, and the system can catch up.
 Soon, it reaches a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maximum throughput
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where the latencies go up to about 1 second.
 You can see on the realtime x axis that the replay is delayed as a whole.
 This can be better seen at the delay diagram:
\end_layout

\family typewriter

 loads.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collapsing point
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is about 60s, which means that it roughly can deliver 600 random IOPS.
 This can be even better seen at the overwiew

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Now we turn to better hardware: the SAS system uses smaller disks with 15k
 RPM, and thus needs more spindles to reach the same capacity.
 If we would run the same test for 300s (as in the SATA case), we would
 not notice any collapsing.
 Thus we double 
\family typewriter
replay_duration
\family default
 to 600s in order to be able to see the collapsing point.
 Please take this into account when looking at the following graphics:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Notice that the system is even able to reproduce the bursting behaviour
 of the load, much better than the SATA system.
 Only at higher request rates, some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blurring clouds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 appear on the x axis, until it finally collapses under too high load.
 It is amazing to see the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

binary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 behaviour at the collapsing point: as soon as the actual throughput rate
 cannot catch up with the request rate, the internal queues will suddenly
 grow up to some internal maximum, and thus lead to latencies around 0.1
 seconds, which is better than SATA by an order of magnitude.
 Of course, the same effect can be observed at the delay diagram and the
 detailed throughput diagram:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overload tests with natural loads are probably the most interesting ones.
 They can tell you a lot upon both the test candidate, as well as upon your
 application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases, natural loads are varying very much over time.
 Frequently, the variance in the IOPS rate can span an order of magnitude,
 or even more.
 Typical reasons are cron jobs or nightly backups on an otherwise (almost)
 idle server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to find the peaks in the load, you have to draw 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
s from production servers for at least 24h.
 After conversion to 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
, it is rather cumbersome to find the load peaks by hand in order to get
 suitable input data for 
\emph on
overload
\emph default
 tests.
 Thus, we have developed the script 
\family typewriter
create_derived_load.sh
\family default
 which will do the following for you:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It splits the input file(s) into snippets of equal length in realtime (by
 default, 5min length each).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It sorts the snippets according to IOPS in reverse order, i.e.
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

heaviest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 snippet will come first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It distributes the snippets to a number of output files in a round-robin
 fashion (while adjusting the timestamps to the new order).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result, the output files will start with the heaviest IOPS load first,
 and later declining.
 This methodology has a number of advantages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The overload part is easily accessible at the beginning of each output file
 (interesting part first).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Thanks to the distribution to many output files, higher replay parallelism
 is possible in an uncorrolated way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In case your test candidate should get overloaded: you can easily see its
 
\emph on
recovery behaviour
\emph default
 from overload, thanks to the declination of the load over time.
 Will it recover at all, and how fast?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter is an important property of any enterprise-grade storage system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some example comparisons between an old SATA system and a newer
 SAS system, both equipped with hardware RAID-6, and loaded with a replay
 parallelism of 4.

It is interesting to observe the behaviour of the SATA system in contrast
 to the high-performance SAS: at first, the real IOPS rate (orange) cannot
 catch up with the demanded rate (green).
 However, when the demanded rate decreases under the green line after some
 time, the orange line becomes higher than the green one until the backlog
 has been worked up.
 Finally, the system can (almost) run in sync with the lower demands, and
 the orange line is hiding the green one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same effects can also be seen in the corresponding delay diagrams, where
 you can even notice multiple top lines stemming from overlay of replays
 in parallel, and even watch their different fallback points:

 Interestingly, this carpet falls a little down at the end, when the replay

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we turn to

\begin_layout Standard
Now we turn to

 Most of the time, there is almost the same behaviour as before.

 tells us that the real last tail consists almost exclusively of pushed-back
 requests.
 In detail, there are lots of requests depending on each other 
\emph on
transitively
\emph default
, reaching over many generations.
 They have accumulated over a long time, because 
\family typewriter

 is 
\emph on
defined

 to do so.
 The tail is nothing but catch-up of pushed-back requests which could not
 be run earlier, in order to obey the storage semantics.
 Many of them are mutually hindering each other.
 The ordinary non-conflicting requests form a different class than then
 conflicting ones, leading to a 2-class society with different chances to
 be processed (unfairness).
 Thus one of the both classes finishes earlier than the other.
 This is a disadvantage of 
\family typewriter
--with-partial
\family default
 you should know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, this can be turned into an advantage, because you can
 use 
\family typewriter
--with-partial
\family default
 for detection of such a behaviour.
 Think of the race between Achilles and the turtle.
 If you find a much slower turtle, your test candidate has probably some
 problems with that 
\emph on
specific
\emph default
 load, but not necessarily with other loads at the same IOPS level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: the 2-class society caused by

 is often visible in the delay diagrams.
 Check out yourself!

\begin_layout Standard
Let us return to the comparion of request ordering modes: more prominent
 differences can be found when we turn to

 Why should

It is clear that a too low number of threads, such as 8, can hinder overall
 throughput (even when in reality the total IO parallelism is

 It is therefore no wonder that 16 through 64 threads perform better than
 8.
 But, why is there a counter-productive break-down when increasing the number

This result is unexpected.
 In theory, it should not make any difference whether there is 1 request
 in between the main thread and a worker, or many.
 However, in practice it makes a difference: the 
\emph on
communication latencies
\emph default
 over the pipelines are avoided when the pipeline remains always filled
 with some requests in advance.

When

logical request
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 can be either working in a worker thread, or being processed by the main
 thread, or underway over the pipes.
 It cannot be present at more than one of these places at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example, just for demonstration of the principle: Assume that the IO
 system can catch up (at least at the beginning), and that the IO latencies
 are 
\emph on
constant
\emph default
.
 Assume that the communication latencies are exactly the same constant.
 What will be the effect? One half of the requests will always reside in
 the IO system, but the other half will reside in the pipe communication
 infrastructure, in average.
 Did you get the point?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, assume that both the IO latencies as well as the communication latencies
 are varying (e.g.
 due to kernel scheduling etc).
 Then the queue length might be staggering around, as observed in the following

File Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
*.replay.gz
\family default
 files are in essence compressed CSV files, using 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

;
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\family default
 as delimiter.
 However, errors and comments can also occur in the file, violating the
 classical CSV format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to extract classical CSV, use the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\family typewriter
zgrep 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

;
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph on
myname
\emph default
.replay.gz | less
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first line of the output contains the column names (and could be removed
 by inserting 
\family typewriter
| tail -n +2
\family default
 into the pipeline).
 In 
\emph on
theory
\emph default
, you could even use MS Excel to work on the above output.
 However, in practice the file will be so extremely large that interactive
 workstation tools will likely start swapping your system to death, or even
 bombing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the usual way to operate on the output is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pipe and filters style
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, using stream-processing tools like 
\family typewriter
sed
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
awk
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
perl
\family default
, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
*.replay.gz
\family default
 use the same format.
 However, 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
 
\series bold
\emph on
must
\series default
\emph default
 be sorted numerically according to the timestamp, while 
\family typewriter
*.replay.gz
\family default
 is usually unsorted (roughly showing the order of request completion in
 most cases, which is different from the submission timestamp ordering).
 In order to re-use 
\family typewriter
*.replay.gz
\family default
 again as input for another run of 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
, you must sort it with 
\family typewriter
sort -n
\family default
.
 In some cases, public 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 recordings at 
\family typewriter
www.blktrace.org/loads/
\family default
 will contain only constants 0.0 as delays and latencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feel free to filter your results, or create your own artifical loads.

Validation of the

\family default
 Tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some effort has been spent to check that 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 really produces the intended kind of IO load on the target system, and
 that its measurement results are likely to be valid.
 However, there is no guarantee against hidden bugs, misconfigurations,
 or other types of accidents.
 See also the disclaimer of the GPL license.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following tools try the 
\emph on
help
\emph default
 you by making 
\family typewriter

\family default
 as transparent to the public as possible, but cannot form an absolute guarantee
 against all possible sources of errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please report any bugs to the author, or, even better, send patches or git
 pull requests.

\begin_layout Section
Running 
\family typewriter
blktrace

 during 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The timeliness of IO requests is already measured and displayed by the 
\family typewriter
*.latency.*
\family default
 graphics.
 The following steps will thus concentrate on 
\emph on
completeness
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to check that all IO requests present in a 
\family typewriter
*.load.gz
\family default
 file are actually applied to the test candidate, you can (and should) re-record
 the IO load during an execution of 
\family typewriter
blkreplay
\family default
 via 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
.
 The following steps are to be done manually:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 manually, as described in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:How-to-use"

\end_inset

, 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 you start 
\family typewriter
tree-replay.sh
\family default
.
 Be sure to catch all involved devices on all involved hosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Either kill 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 with Ctrl-C 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 tree-replay.sh is done, or use the 
\family typewriter
-w
\family default
 option to specify a 
\emph on
strictly longer
\emph default
 (plus some safety margin) recording time.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Attention! some versions of 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 seem to loose some requests in some buffers, at least under some conditions.
 Usually the number of lost events is rather low, about 10.
 Keep that in mind if you later discover some purpoted discrepancies!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Copy the resulting 
\family typewriter
*.blktrace.[0-9]+
\family default
 file to your workstation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Invoke 
\family typewriter
/path/to/blkreplay/scripts/check_replay_against_blktrace.sh 
\emph on
myresult
\emph default
.replay.gz 
\emph on

\begin_inset Newline newline

Hint: the coincidence between 
\family typewriter
\emph on
myresult
\emph default
.replay.gz
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
\emph on
myload
\emph default
.load.gz
\family default
 must be checked separately, using tools like 
\family typewriter
cut
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
diff
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Enjoy the result in form of a wide side-by-side 
\family typewriter
diff
\family default
 output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: no output means that no differences have been found.
 The timeliness as well as the order of requests is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 checked.
 Any difference means that a request is missing somewhere, or has been altered
 in some way.
 Expect some minor differences (usully less than 1%, but sometimes more)
 from request splitting by some device drivers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keep in mind that sometimes 
\family typewriter
blktrace
\family default
 looses some events, leading to

 The sheer masses of data written to

 In particular, the main thread (additionally indicated by

The time differences before and after

 (aka stalls in

 When these numbers get too high, this time you should be alerted quite
 rightly.

The time difference of the main thread it is spending for answer wait.
 Not to be confused with communication latencies! High number will occur
 regularly.
 It is even a sign of good performance when the cumulation almost reaches
 the total processing time.
